# GoLangExercise
I am starting to learn Golang because of my internship at Outreach. These are the exercises I did when going through the [Go tutorial](https://tour.golang.org/list).

- LoopFunctions.go
    - [Exercise Prompt](https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/8)
    - practices `for loop`
- slices.go
     - [Exercise Prompt](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/18)
     - practices `slice`
     - Notes: Slices are refrences to arrays. They do not store any data.
- maps.go
    - [Exercise Prompt](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/23)
    - practices `Map`
- Fibonacci closure 
    - [Exercise Prompt](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/26)
    - practices `function closure`
- equBinaryTrees.go
    - [Exercise Prompt](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/7)
    - Practices concurrency, go routine
